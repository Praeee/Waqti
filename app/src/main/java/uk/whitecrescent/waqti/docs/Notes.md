# Notes

* Boards will contain Lists, there will be merger Boards which will contain the contents of one or more other Boards

* Collections like Tuples, Lists, TimedLists, Boards and maybe others, TodayList, PriorityList Lists that allow only 
specific Tasks etc

* Lists will contain Tasks (and Tuples), there will be Lists with types such as TimedLists like a List for Today etc,
 there will also be Lists that allow only certain Tasks 

* Tuples are an ordering of Tasks using each Task's before Property

* Routine is a pre-defined Tuple or Task that occurs every so often and can become a Habit

* Habit is like a checkable list for each iteration of the Task/Tuple, Habits require a Routine to be killed which is
 what signifies the habit has been done
 
* Goal is a number of successes to have for a Habit, for example study French 30 times over the course of a month

* Priority collisions are not done on the Task level, they are done on the List level, specifically TimedLists which 
will check all their elements and see for collisions

* Calendar

* Recurring Tasks is a Collection of Anonymous Tasks

* Anonymous Tasks are non real Tasks that constrain that the real Task must have the same non-default Properties as 
the anonymous Task's Properties (like a placeholder)

* Macros are basically a skeleton/ framework to build up a list from, a collection of Tasks (Template or non)

* Moments are like reminders or notifications not Tasks

* Sorting, Searching and Analytics

* Free time decider using Recurring Tasks
